# Handwritten Number Recognition

This project is a demonstration of using a neural network entirely client side to recognise digits drawn by the user in a canvas

### TODO

- [ ] Add a way to store and download weights from a pre trained network to avoid training time
- [ ] Improve accuracy by making scale and position invariant
  - Maybe something like a convnet would be useful?
- [ ] Use sliding window to read a string of digits (could also help previous)

### Technologies Used

- React
- Create React App
- Deeplearn.js
